# AI-Vacuum-Cleaner
A python program to simulate the working of an intelligent vacuum cleaner.
This program uses Turtle graphics to graphically depict the path of the vacuum cleaner.
*Techniques used-
1.1)Uninformed search-DFS(Modified to avoid repeated states)
1.2)Informed search-2 different heuristics have been used
*Driver program options-
1.1)Display room environment
1.2)Show vacuum cleaner path corresponding to DFS
1.3)Show vacuum cleaner path corresponding to Greedy algorithm
1.4)Comparative Analysis
