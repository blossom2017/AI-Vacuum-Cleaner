# AI-Vacuum-Cleaner
A python program to simulate the working of an intelligent vacuum cleaner.
This program uses Turtle graphics to graphically depict the path of the vacuum cleaner.<br/>

-Techniques used-<br/>
1.Uninformed search-DFS(Modified to avoid repeated states)<br/>
2.Informed search-2 different heuristics have been used<br/>
-Driver program options-<br/>
1.Display room environment<br/>
2.Show vacuum cleaner path corresponding to DFS<br/>
3.Show vacuum cleaner path corresponding to Greedy algorithm<br/>
4.Comparative Analysis<br/>
