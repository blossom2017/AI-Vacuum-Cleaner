# AI-Vacuum-Cleaner
A python program to simulate the working of an intelligent vacuum cleaner.
This program uses Turtle graphics to graphically depict the path of the vacuum cleaner.
Techniques used-
1)Uninformed search-DFS(Modified to avoid repeated states)
2)Informed search-2 different heuristics have been used
Driver program options-
1)Display room environment
2)Show vacuum cleaner path corresponding to DFS
3)Show vacuum cleaner path corresponding to Greedy algorithm
4)Comparative Analysis
